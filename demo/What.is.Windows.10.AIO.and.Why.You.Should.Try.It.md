In this article, we will explain what are the benefits of using Windows 10 AIO, how to download it, and how to install it on your PC.
 
## The Benefits of Using Windows 10 AIO
 
There are several reasons why you might want to use Windows 10 AIO instead of the regular Windows 10 ISO file. Here are some of them:
 
- You can choose from different editions of Windows 10 according to your needs and preferences. For example, if you are a home user, you can choose Windows 10 Home; if you are a professional or a business user, you can choose Windows 10 Pro; if you need advanced features and security, you can choose Windows 10 Enterprise; and if you are a student or a teacher, you can choose Windows 10 Education.
- You can save time and bandwidth by downloading only one ISO file instead of multiple ones. This is especially helpful if you have a slow or limited internet connection.
- You can create a bootable USB flash drive or DVD with multiple editions of Windows 10 on it. This way, you can use the same installation media for different PCs or devices that require different editions of Windows 10.
- You can update your existing edition of Windows 10 to a higher one without losing your data or settings. For example, if you have Windows 10 Home and you want to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, you can use Windows 10 AIO to do so.

7. Save the ISO file or run the media creation tool on your PC.
